Mixtape and video app
This is an open source approach to releasing an independent mixtape album / demo.  Here you will find the beats, tracks, and vocals, used to produce the mixtape (also available on Bancamp) and any music videos as apps. 
Contribute any remixes or additional guest tracks as Pull requests. 
Theme for all = COVID pandemic 2020.
